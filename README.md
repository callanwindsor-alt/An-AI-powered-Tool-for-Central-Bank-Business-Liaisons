## Abstract

In a world of increasing policy uncertainty, central banks are relying more on soft information sources 
to complement traditional economic statistics and model-based forecasts. One valuable source of 
soft information comes from intelligence gathered through central bank liaison programs –
structured programs in which central bank staff regularly talk with firms to gather insights. This 
paper introduces a new text analytics and retrieval tool that efficiently processes, organises, and 
analyses liaison intelligence gathered from firms using modern natural language processing 
techniques. The textual dataset spans 25 years, integrates new information as soon as it becomes 
available, and covers a wide range of business sizes and industries.
The tool uses both traditional text analysis techniques and powerful language models to provide 
analysts and researchers with three key capabilities: (1) quickly querying the entire history of 
business liaison meeting notes; (2) zooming in on particular topics to examine their frequency (topic 
exposure) and analysing the associated tone and uncertainty of the discussion; and (3) extracting 
precise numerical values from the text, such as firms’ reported figures for wages and prices growth.
We demonstrate how these capabilities are useful for assessing economic conditions by generating 
text-based indicators of wages growth and incorporating them into a nowcasting model. We find 
that adding these text-based features to current best-in-class predictive models, combined with the 
use of machine learning methods designed to handle many predictors, significantly improves the 
performance of nowcasts for wages growth. Predictive gains are driven by a small number of 
features, indicating a sparse signal in contrast to other predictive problems in macroeconomics, 
where the signal is typically dense.
